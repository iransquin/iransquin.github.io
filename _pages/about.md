Driven by my taste for challenges and innovation, I studied engineering in energy and aeronautics to acquire a strong background in technical skills. Fascinated by the environment that surrounds us, I am convinced that I have a role to play in the building of new environment-friendly solutions for the challenges the world will have to tackle in the future.
